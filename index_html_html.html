<h1>Economy of the City</h1>
<p>The industry in Uralsk is presented by power engineering, machine-building, food and flour-grinding, light and construction industries.

Machine-building industry began developing in the city after a number of plants were evacuated there from Leningrad. As a result a plant was organized which changed its digital name into the name Voroshilov (“Zenit” nowadays). Among the main products are military ships and cutter production.

In the development of Uralsk city industry Karachaganak oil and gas condensate deposit is of great importance. It is located 150 km from Uralsk on the territory of Burlinsky district. This is not only one of the most important natural gas object of Kazakhstan but also a large liquid hydro-carbon deposit</p>
