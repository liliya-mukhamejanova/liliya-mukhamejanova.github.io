<p>Yaitsky settlement was founded in 1584 (1613 is the official date of the city foundation). It was founded on the peninsula between rivers Yaik (Ural) and Chagan. In 1591 Cossacks living in the region became the citizens of Russian state, but till Peter I ruling they were absolutely self-governing.</p>

<p>Beside Cossacks a lot of Tatars lived in the city. Tatars joined the army, a lot of them were officers. But trade was their main occupation, Tatars were a kind of connecting link between Russia and nomad clans of Kazakhs. First newspapers in Kazakh language were published at Tatar publishing houses in Uralsk.</p>

<p>By 1846 Uralsk became a large trade center. In 1894 a railway was constructed till Uralsk, it was named Ryazansko-Uralskaya and it promoted further development of the city.</p>
